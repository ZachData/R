# For the model, we see the results of a linear regression model that predicts the victim's age group based on the perpetrator's age group. The coefficients estimate the average difference in the victim's age group for each one-unit increase in the perpetrator's age group.

# In conclusion, race appears to play a role in shootings. Individuals who are Black are much more satistically likely to be both victims of shootings and (statistically) die because of them. Age and the difference of day/night do not appear to be useful. More information and analysis would be needed to have a deeper understanding of the information at hand.

This dataset could be biased because we only see what is reported, not the actual events which occurred.

Additionally, there may be other types of bias in the data, such as under-reporting or over-reporting of certain demographic groups. For example, if certain races or ethnicities are less likely to report incidents of police shootings, the data may not accurately reflect the true frequency or distribution of such incidents among different demographic groups.

It is important to keep the potential sources of bias of a dataset in mind, the data may be unintentionally misleading in nuanced ways.
